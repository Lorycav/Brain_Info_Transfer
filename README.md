## Data
The data used in the first part of the work can be retrieved from this publicy avaiable [EEG dataset](https://datadryad.org/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.8m2g3).
In the second analysis of real data, the dataset is in `P1.xlsx`.

## Requisites

Libraries:
* ```numpy```
* ```pandas```
* ```matplotlib```

## Scripts
```final_notebook.ipynb``` is the notebook containing all the results computed with the following scripts:

* ```info_utils.py```: contains functions to compute information theoretic measures
* ```plot_utils.py```: contains functions to plot the results
* ```parameters.py```: contains all the global parameters used in the computations
* ```visualize_graphs.py```: display graphs of DM halos from the simulations

* ```create_json_simulations.py```: create the simulated time series and save in json files
* ```heatmap.py```: create the heatmaps
* ```tempor_loc.py```: compute the temporal location of the neural activity
* ```significance.py```: perform the significance tests
* `fit_te_snr.py`: run the behaviour of FIT and TE wrt SNR

* `eeg_analysis_parallel.py`: to parallely compute the analysis on the first eeg dataset
* `eeg_new_analysis_parallel.py`: to parallely compute the analysis on the second eeg dataset
